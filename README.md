# File Stash

### https://storage.suryasekhardatta.com/

---

A simple website to temporarily store and share small files!

_Note:  All files auto-delete 30 days after uplading them_

### Ideas

- [ ] Make APIs service for file uploads and downloads.
- [ ] Same file name collision problem solve
- [ ] Rate limit the API with API Keys (auth required)
- [ ] Every file has unique UUIDs as S3 primary key
- [ ] User Authorization and upload private files
- [ ] Folders ?
- [ ] File Encryption before S3 upload (needs authentication module first)
